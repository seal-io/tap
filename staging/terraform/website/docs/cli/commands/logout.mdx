# Command: logout

The `terraform logout` command is used to remove credentials stored by
`terraform login`. These credentials are API tokens for Terraform Cloud,
Terraform Enterprise, or any other host that offers Terraform services.

## Usage

Usage: `terraform logout [hostname]`

If you don't provide an explicit hostname, Terraform will assume you want to
log out of Terraform Cloud at `app.terraform.io`.

-> **Note:** the API token is only removed from local storage, not destroyed on
the remote server, so it will remain valid until manually revoked.

## Credentials Storage

By default, Terraform will remove the token stored in plain text in a local CLI
configuration file called `credentials.tfrc.json`. If you have configured a
[credentials helper program](/terraform/cli/config/config-file#credentials-helpers), Terraform
will use the helper's `forget` command to remove it.
