# `filesha512` Function

`filesha512` is a variant of [`sha512`](/terraform/language/functions/sha512)
that hashes the contents of a given file rather than a literal string.

This is similar to `sha512(file(filename))`, but
because [`file`](/terraform/language/functions/file) accepts only UTF-8 text it cannot be used to
create hashes for binary files.
