# `filesha256` Function

`filesha256` is a variant of [`sha256`](/terraform/language/functions/sha256)
that hashes the contents of a given file rather than a literal string.

This is similar to `sha256(file(filename))`, but
because [`file`](/terraform/language/functions/file) accepts only UTF-8 text it cannot be used to
create hashes for binary files.
