tfcoremock_simple_resource.drift: Refreshing state... [id=cb79269e-dc39-1e68-0a9c-63cb392afda9]

Note: Objects have changed outside of Terraform

Terraform detected the following changes made outside of Terraform since the
last "terraform apply" which may have affected this plan:

  # tfcoremock_simple_resource.drift has changed
  ~ resource "tfcoremock_simple_resource" "drift" {
        id     = "cb79269e-dc39-1e68-0a9c-63cb392afda9"
      ~ string = "Hello, world!" -> "Hello, drift!"
    }


This is a refresh-only plan, so Terraform will not take any actions to undo
these. If you were expecting these changes then you can apply this plan to
record the updated values in the Terraform state without changing any remote
objects.

Saved the plan to: equivalence_test_plan

To perform exactly these actions, run the following command to apply:
    terraform apply "equivalence_test_plan"
